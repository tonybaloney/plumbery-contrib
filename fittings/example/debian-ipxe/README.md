# Debian network installation with iPXE and DNSMASQ (experimental)

This is a minimal project, where one Debian node is deployed at the [Managed Cloud Platform from Dimension Data](http://cloud.dimensiondata.com/eu/en/).
This is done with [plumbery](https://developer.dimensiondata.com/display/PLUM/Plumbery) and a template that is provided below.

Warning: this use case is provided only for experimentations. At this point in
time Debian is not supported by Dimension Data.

The idea is to deploy a small Ubuntu node first, and then to install iPXE to
reboot on Debian over the wire. For this a small DHCP and file server is
provided separately. Then the boot sequence is modified to boot the
Debian kernel directly.

## Requirements for this use case

* Select a MCP location
* Add a Network Domain
* Add an Ethernet network
* Deploy a Ubuntu node
* Monitor this server in the real-time dashboard provided by Dimension Data
* Assign a public IPv4 address
* Add address translation to ensure end-to-end IP connectivity
* Add firewall rule to accept TCP traffic on port 22 (ssh)
* Download iPXE and make it the default choice for node boot
* Configure iPXE to get network configuration and to load Debian from a trusted repository
* Deploy a Ubuntu node to act as DHCP and HTTP server on the VLAN
* Monitor this server in the real-time dashboard provided by Dimension Data
* Assign a public IPv4 address
* Add address translation to ensure end-to-end IP connectivity
* Add firewall rule to accept TCP traffic on port 22 (ssh)
* Install and configure DHCP to feed the Debian node
* Install and expose files over TFTP to support iPXE boot operations

## Fittings plan

[Click here to read fittings.yaml](fittings.yaml)

## Deployment command

    $ python -m plumbery fittings.yaml deploy

This command will build fittings as per the provided plan, start the server
and bootstrap it. Look at messages displayed by plumbery while it is
working, so you can monitor what's happening.

## Follow-up commands

At the end of the deployment, plumbery will display on screen some instructions
to help you move forward. You can ask plumbery to display this information
at any time with the following command:

    $ python -m plumbery fittings.yaml information

Since no network information is given to the Debian node, it cannot be
accessed over the Internet. The only way to login to the machine is to use the
console access, via the Cloud Control web user interface.

From the console you can select the best option to install Debian on the node.

## Troubleshooting

This use case is purely experimental, and has the only merit to demonstrate
how different building blocks can be orchestrated to boot a node over the wire.

## Destruction commands

Launch following command to remove all resources involved in the fittings plan:

    $ python -m plumbery fittings.yaml dispose

## Use case status

- [X] Work as expected
