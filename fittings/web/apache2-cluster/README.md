# Cluster of Apache web servers behind the load-balancer integrated in the Managed Cloud Platform

The objective of this use case is to pool multiple web server, at the [Managed Cloud Platform from Dimension Data](http://cloud.dimensiondata.com/eu/en/).
This is done with [plumbery](https://developer.dimensiondata.com/display/PLUM/Plumbery) and a template that is provided below.

The web service is accessible from the Internet via a single public IPv4 address. Traffic is balanced across available
web servers by the load-balancer that is coming with the Managed Cloud Platform itself.

## Requirements for this use case

* Select a MCP location
* Add a Network Domain
* Add an Ethernet network
* Deploy 10 web servers
* Monitor these servers in the real-time dashboard provided by Dimension Data
* Pool servers
* Add a listener and configure load-balancing
* Assign a public IPv4 address to the load-balancer
* Add address translation to ensure end-to-end IP connectivity
* Add firewall rule to accept TCP traffic on port 22 (ssh) and 80 (web)
* Update the operating system
* Synchronise node clock with NTP
* Install a new SSH key to secure remote communications
* Configure SSH to reject passwords and to prevent access from root account
* Install Apache2 and PHP
* Reflect server name at web home pages
