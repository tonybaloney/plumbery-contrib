# Cluster of MongoDB servers

The objective of this use case is to pool multiple MongoDB servers, at the [Managed Cloud Platform from Dimension Data](http://cloud.dimensiondata.com/eu/en/).
This is done with [plumbery](https://developer.dimensiondata.com/display/PLUM/Plumbery) and a template that is provided below.

MongoDB is a database that is really well-adapted to NoSQL storage and to real-time data analytics.
In this use case we will deploy multiple servers, and glue them together.

## Requirements for this use case

* Select a MCP location
* Add a Network Domain
* Add an Ethernet network
* Deploy multiple Ubuntu servers
* Add a virtual disk to selected nodes
* Monitor these servers in the real-time dashboard provided by Dimension Data
* Assign public IPv4 addresses to nodes
* Add address translation to ensure end-to-end IP connectivity
* Add firewall rule to accept TCP traffic on port 22 (ssh)
* Combine virtual disks into a single expanded logical volume (LVM)
* Update the operating system of each node
* Synchronise nodes clock with NTP
* Install a new SSH key to secure remote communications
* Configure SSH to reject passwords and to prevent access from root account
* Add MongoDB to all servers
* Create a cluster of configuration servers
* Add sharding servers
