# GitLab Community Edition and Samba server, core internal services for developers

The objective of this use case is to deploy core private services for developers, at the [Managed Cloud Platform from Dimension Data](http://cloud.dimensiondata.com/eu/en/).
This is done with [plumbery](https://developer.dimensiondata.com/display/PLUM/Plumbery) and a template that is provided below.

GitLab includes Git repository management, code reviews, issue tracking, wikis, and more, plus GitLab CI, an easy-to-use continuous integration and deployment tool.

Collaborate with your team using issues, milestones, and line-by-line code review. View activity streams of projects or the people you work with.

GitLab seamlessly integrates with Slack, Hipchat, LDAP, JIRA, Jenkins, and many other popular tools. GitLab includes many webhooks and offers a complete API.
